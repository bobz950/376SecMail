STUFF THAT WE GOTTA DO FROM PSEUDOCODE - 

For log in, user needs to be prompted BY THE CLIENT to log in before they have access to ask for notifications/emails or write emails
Then they would have access to GUI interface, but not before verifying log in.

	To pull notification, maybe something like this?  
	if (buttonForYesNotificationsIsPressedInGUI) 
	{
	//send command to server for notification to be sent to client from server
	//prompt if user wants to pull emails notified by the notifications sent as well
	//if (userSaysYesToPullingEmails) {//pull some goddamn emails son}
	}	

	Begin by telling server we want notication = 
	client then sends request - it sends a packet header that has the command for enum (GET_NOTIFICATION)
	it's just the command - packetheader object in packetheader.java
		
	server then recieves message that client wants email messages
	server sends back commmand to send notification which is a packet header (SEND_NOTIFICATION)
	multiple packets sent with notification?
	send notification object, but we gotta come up with what a notification object is
	then it sends another command for get notification until it runs out of emails in the list and therefore notifications

	now server is sending the packets and client is waiting and receiving them
	we run out of notifications and we gota tell client that via command (END_NOTIFICATION)
	while loop and send notifications until its' done and client will receive notifications
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	pull mail - similar structure to notifications - will figure out more concrete later

	Do we store emails? yes, on your own server
	
	email needs to be complete and closed as a packet
	server needs to know i will accept email, server is listening specifically for email and not packet
	give it packet header for that - SEND_EMAIL command
	send EMAIL OBJECT
	after email is received communiction from server to client that says email received
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can David OR Josh work on log in prompting from client before user can have access to GUI interface for pulling notifications
and create the necessary objects (notification object so it can be passed) and atempt to 
use the commands to pass it?

I'll (Geri) work on the remaining things for the two top methods for pulling notifications with Yovana. 
I'll work on notification pulling, Yovana will do email pulling.

If any group gets finished with their task before Tuesday, they should try and help the other group if they can
